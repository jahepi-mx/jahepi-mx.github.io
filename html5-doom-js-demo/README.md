# Project
My goal for this project was to mimic certain features of the Doom engine using Canvas and plain JavaScript. I tried to figure out the math behind it. (As **John Carmack** once said, you don’t need more than a good foundation in high school math and basic linear algebra to achieve something like Quake.) That said, take with a grain of salt how I approached some of the problems I tackled—I’m sure there are better, more optimal solutions. I didn’t use any BSP for rendering since I still need to wrap my head around it. Instead, I rendered what was visible between sectors, processing them from back to front.

I kept the code to a minimum. It’s not the best code I’ve ever written, but I’m really happy with the final outcome.

Don’t be scared; I love Goya’s paintings. In case you’re wondering, the painting is called _Saturn Devouring His Son_.
